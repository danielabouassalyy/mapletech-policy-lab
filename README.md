- We started by defining three custom Azure Policies: one that only allows deployments in Canada Central, one that requires every resource to have a ProjectName tag, and one that blocks any Public IP address from being created. Next we grouped those policies into a single Policy Initiative called MapleTech Secure Foundation so they could be managed and assigned together as a coherent set of guardrails. Finally we assigned that initiative to our test resource group in Enforce mode, which activated all three policies at once and automatically denied any non-compliant deployments.
